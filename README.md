# How that works? ü§î

All piano keys is a capacitive touch sensors.
The microcontroller continuously measure needed time for change pin state from 0 to 1 and and back
That's have little lag, because any gpio pin have parasitic capacitance.
And when finger touches pin there is a current leak happens and time to charge/discharge changes.

The algorithm is simple:
1. Change pin to input with internal pull-up
2. Measure time until pin have `1` state
3. Change pin to output=1 for complete charge parasitic capacitor
4. Change pin to input with internal pull-down
5. Measure time until pin have `0` state
6. Change pin to output=0 for complete discharge parasitic capacitor

Any deviations in these measured times is meaning for key press.

Just connect piece of foil to microcontroller. And that's all, lol.

Current pinout which use in the code:

|Pin|Note|
|---|---|
|PB13|C3|
|PB14|C3#|
|PB15|D3|
|PB12|D3#|
|PA8|E3|
|PB8|F3|
|PB9|F3#|
|PB7|G3|
|PB3|G3#|
|PA1|A3|
|PB1|A3#|
|PA0|B3|
|PB4|C4|
|PB0|C4#|
|PA7|D4|
|PA2|D4#|
|PA4|E4|
|PB5|F4|
|PB11|F4#|
|PA5|G4|
|PA15|G4#|
|PA3|A4|
|PA6|A4#|
|PB6|B4|
|PB10|C4|

But you can connect key in any random order and just generate new `App::m_pins` using `DEBUG_SORT_KEYS=true` mode.

That's exactly what I did ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

# Configuration

Okay you built this device. And as expected, nothing works. These is scam???? üò±

No, that's okay. Different constructions have different parameters and my settings maybe not suitable for you. 

Mainly, you need tune these parameters for your device:
| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| SENSOR_WHITE_KEY_THRESHOLD | 1000 | Threshold for white key, at which deviation (in %) will mean key is pressed.<br>This value in percentages multiplied to 100.<br>100000=100%|
| SENSOR_BLACK_KEY_THRESHOLD | 1000 | Threshold for black key, at which deviation (in %) will mean key is pressed.<br>This value in percentages multiplied to 100.<br>100000=100%|

Other parameters:
| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| NOTE_OFFSET | 48 | MIDI note for first key: 36 - C2, 48 - C3<br>See for more info: https://studiocode.dev/resources/midi-middle-c/ |
| KEY_VELOCITY | 64 | Velocity of key press |
| DEBOUNCE_CYCLES | 1000000 | Time for debounce. Value in the cpu cycles. This value used to reduce  jittering keys state. |
| CALIBRATION_CYCLES | 100 | Cycles for measure average capacitance for initial state. |
| SAMPLES_CNT | 8 | Cycles for averaging measured capacitance |
| DEBUG_SORT_KEYS | false | Debug mode for generatin new `App::m_pins` in right order |
| DEBUG_PRESS_KEYS | false | Debug mode for tune thresholds |

You can find all of these parameters in [src/App.h](src/App.h)
