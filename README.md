# How that works? ü§î

All piano keys is a capacitive touch sensors.
The microcontroller continuously measure needed time for change pin state from 0 to 1 and and back
That's have little lag, because any gpio pin have parasitic capacitance.
And when finger touches pin there is a current leak happens and time to charge/discharge changes.

The algorithm is simple:
1. Change pin to input with internal pull-up
2. Measure time until pin have `1` state
3. Change pin to output=1 for complete charge parasitic capacitor
4. Change pin to input with internal pull-down
5. Measure time until pin have `0` state
6. Change pin to output=0 for complete discharge parasitic capacitor

Any deviations in these measured times is meaning for key press.

Current pinout which use in the code:

|PB13|C3|
|PB14|C3#|
|PB15|D3|
|PB12|D3#|
|PA8|E3|

|PA15|G4#|

But you can connect key in any random order and just generate new `App::m_pins` using `DEBUG_SORT_KEYS=true` mode.

That's exactly what I did ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
